This repository demonstrates two uncommon types of HTML errors that don't immediately throw errors but can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues. The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides corrected versions.  The errors involve accessing properties of undefined objects and improper element nesting.  These often cause subtle bugs that are difficult to track down because no error messages are generated.
