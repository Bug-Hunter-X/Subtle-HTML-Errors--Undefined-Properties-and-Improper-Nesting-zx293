  <div id="myDiv"></div>
  <script>
    // This code attempts to access a property of an undefined object.
    // It will not throw an error, but will return undefined, leading to unexpected behavior.
    let myVar = myDiv.myProperty;
    console.log(myVar); // outputs undefined

    // Another common issue is using the wrong tag or attribute which would not throw an error but produce unexpected results.
    // for example using <p> instead of <h1> for headings would make the page look unorganized but it won't throw error.
    
    // Similarly, an improperly nested element (like missing closing tags) won't always produce an error, but cause rendering problems. 
    // If you look at the source code, you'll notice that a closing tag for <p> is missing and there are no errors on the browser's console. 
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>This is not in a paragraph tag, but would be considered part of it by the browser. </body>
